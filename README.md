# Object-Size-Measurement-using-Aruco-Marker
This project is all about aruco detection and its application. This project is done using python language.

# Project- Procedure :

Step 01: Environment Setup
Step 02: Code Implementation

01. Environment setup:
   We are using VS Code for Python IDE. In this project we are using custom OpenCV library named "Opencv-contrib-python". To install this library in the virtual environment, we need to run the terminal and type

                              "pip install opencv-contrib-python".

 The opencv-contrib library consists of some extra libraries like "numpy", "wheel" , etc. Make sure, you have the latest library version.

3. Code Implementation:
   This project includes two raw codes related to arUco marker. First, we need to detect any object (object_detector.py) and then using arUco homography technique we will measure the size of the object (measure_object_size.py).
